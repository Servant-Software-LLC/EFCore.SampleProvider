# EFCore.SampleProvider
The goal of this repo is to provide to the EFCore community the absolute minimal code needed in order to produce an **EF Core Provider** that is external to the EFCore repo.  In order to avoid the complexities that lie within a provider, this provider with just be a wrapper around the [SQLite in-memory EFCore Provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/testing/choosing-a-testing-strategy#sqlite-as-a-database-fake)([source code](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/tree/main/src/EFCore.Sqlite.Core)).  In effect then, the code within this repo becomes simply the API surface required for an EFCore provider.  Per recommendations of a primary EFCore contributor this provider will be modeled in file/folder structure after the [Npgsql](https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg) and [Pomelo MySQL](https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql) providers. 

This hopefully will (at least partially) address the open issue https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/issues/681
